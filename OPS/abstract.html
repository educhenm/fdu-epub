<p style="text-align: center"><b>Abstract</b></p>

<p style="text-align: left">A number of writing conventions common to nonacademic settings are discussed. Wooleverâ€™s approach to the organization and summary of information is outlined and applied in a variety of writing contexts. The characteristics of email and other online communication are highlighted. Research has resulted in a series of recommendations that writers should be aware of related to the structure and content of their messages. A related topic, the subtle differences between writing targeted for print and the Internet is considered. Several scenarios emphasizing the use of email by students in business environments and the myriad of challenges inherent in writing are evaluated for their impact on how tone and structure may change when writing. Lastly, a whitepaper on collaborative technologies from Cisco Systems is critiqued, noting the positive and negative characteristics of yet another form of nonacademic writing. Writers should make use of these techniques to communicate effectively with their audiences.</p>
